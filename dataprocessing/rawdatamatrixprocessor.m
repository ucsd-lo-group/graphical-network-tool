%% Introduction to SNA Script
% Welcome to the Social Network Analysis Computing Script
% The purpose of this script is to assist in automating computating groups based on a set number of
% individuals in a group. There are observed limitations that this script can do and must be considered
% with the interpretation of the final output of the data.
%
% This script is intended to be used in Mathworks MATLAB, but it may be compatible in GNU Octave. There
% is no guarantee that this script will work in other programs other than MATLAB and the author(s) make
% no such warranty to do so.
%
% This script was developed by Albert Chai and Andrew S. Lee
% Principal Investigator of Project: Stanley M. Lo
%
% You will need both the rawdatamatrixprocessor.m and importfile.m
% functions in your MATLAB Working Directory file in order to run this
% script properly without error

%% Data Import and Initial Processing
% Data in this section are being processed for MATLAB/GNU Octave Reading
% Load the file in MATLAB and right click on the data file. Import the file with each column (such as
% one column is q and one is r). Import using the option 'Create vectors from each column using column names'
% If the variables that are imported do not match 'q' or 'r', use q = {importedqname} or r = {importedrname} to 
% correct for the error.
% Output of the data in the command window is automatically surpressed. To see the output, remove the ';'
% (semicolon) from the code.
disp('Please indicate the file name with extension in your MATLAB Workspace Working Directory')
disp("such as case3-raw.csv")
disp('MATLAB will reprompt you for the file if the syntax is incorrect!')
userInput = input('File: ', 's');
[q,r] = importfile(userInput);
disp('Data import has been completed...')

project_name = input('Project name (press Enter if none): ', 's');

%% Question and Response Matrix Creation
% vs is one matrix containing both q and r data
vs = [q, r];
% q0 and r0 replace the NaN values with zeros for matrix addition in vall
q0 = fillmissing(q,'constant',0);
r0 = fillmissing(r,'constant',0);
% vall function will process all the question and response data into one column in order of sequence
vall = q0+r0;

%% Get number of participants
% Make a conservative estimate (may be higher than actual)
num_participants_possible = max(vall); 

%% Total number of interactions 
% intot determines the total number of interactions the members in the group has. Based on the vall matrix grid.
intot = length(vall)-1; % last row doesn't count
disp(' ')
fprintf('STATUS: The total number of interactions is %d. \n',intot)

%% Member Discussion Order
% Determines the order in which members discussed

% Create edges that show who talked to whom
% assume the person in line n talked to person in line n+1
% assume the file has >= 2 lines
% edge case: the person in last line does not talk to anyone
vallm = [vall(1:end-1), vall(2:end)];
disp('Discussion order has been created.')

%% Student Matrix Interactions
% Determines the number of times students interact with one another in a directed manner
% master_all is a n x 3 matrix, format (source, target, weight) contains all edges
% master is the same as master_all, except without edges where weight <= 0

% Make all possible edges, initialize weight to zero
disp('Script is preallocating vector size for all possible combinations...')
    master_all = zeros(num_participants_possible*num_participants_possible, 3);
disp('Preallocation is complete')

disp('Values are being populated...')
for i = 1: 1: num_participants_possible % i = 1, then 2, 3, 4, ... then lastly num_participants_possible
	for j = 1: 1: num_participants_possible % j = 1, then 2, 3, 4, ... then lastly num_participants_possible
        row_num = (i-1)*num_participants_possible + j; 
        master_all(row_num,1) = i;
        master_all(row_num,2) = j;
	end
end
disp('Combination population complete.')

%% Calculate Weight for Edges
% for each edge in vallm, find the edge in master_all that it matches
% and add 1 to the current value
for i = 1: 1: size(vallm)
   source = vallm(i,1);
   target = vallm(i,2);
   master_all((source-1)*num_participants_possible + target, 3) = master_all((source-1)*num_participants_possible + target, 3) + 1;
end

% make master
% logic: master_all(:,3) > 0 returns an array of 1's and 0's
%   only get the rows with weight greater than 0
master = master_all(master_all(:,3) > 0, :);

%% Export Final Results as .csv Files
% Exports all of the calculated data into 2 .csv files, one with edge list
% and one with weight list corresponding to the edge list.

% Writes Edges List
% config parameters

end
