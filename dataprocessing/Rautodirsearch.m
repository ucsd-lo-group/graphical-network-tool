% All files need to be placed in the fileprocessing folder in order for
% this script to properly function. The dependency scripts must also be in
% the same working directory: autodirsearchmatrixprocessor.m and
% autodirsearchcoredepend.m else the script will fail.

% Change working directory to file processing folder
cd ~/Documents/dev/social-network-analysis/fileprocessing
addpath("~/Documents/dev/social-network-analysis/dataprocessing")

listprocessingraw = ls; %Calls list of items to be processed
listprocessing = strsplit(listprocessingraw, ' ');
listprocessing = strtrim(listprocessing); %Removes trailing spaces
for var = listprocessing
   %Set the file name to be entered into the script
   userInput = var{1};
   project_name = var{1};
   %Call the autodirsearchcoredepend script
   autodirsearchcoredepend
end

% Change directory back to the main source code
